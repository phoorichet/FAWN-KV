Steps to build source code

0. On Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux install the following (to build source)

autoconf automake autotools-dev pkg-config m4 libtool libtbb2 libtbb-dev libboost-dev libssl-dev libgtest-dev

thrift-0.5.0 or later (install from source)
            IMPORTANT: You must apply fawn-thrift.patch patch to the thrift source before compiling
            # cd thrift-0.X.0 && patch -p1 < FAWN-KV/patches/fawn-thrift.patch
             This is to ensure that our sighandler actually kills the TThreadedServer threads properly.
            Source: Bottom of: http://www.mail-archive.com/thrift-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg05155.html

             If using TSimpleServer apply this patch
             http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-567

thrift may require the following packages to build: bison flex ruby-dev python-dev php5-dev
You may also need to install a more specific boost package (libboost-thread-dev) for FAWN-KV.


Make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to support dynamic loader 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

1. autoreconf -is
2. ./configure [--with-ycsb]
3. make

Configure's --with-ycsb option checks to see if you hava java, javac,
and ant, which are required to build the java library that the ycsb
client library needs

On OS X, you may need the following for ./configure
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib" CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/"
(Change directory location as appropriate, see INSTALL.MACOSX for more details)
